# Face_Recognition
One shot learning ML model for Face recognition.

Testing a machine learning model for face recognition using OpenFace pytorch model converted to keras model by https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace

To test the model the code is in google colaboratory. 
steps to test the model 
1)clone this repository to your google drive. 
2)open Face_recognition google colab ipynb and run the code to mount gdrive 
3)put test images in the test_image folder
