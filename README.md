# Face_Recognition
One shot learning ML model for Face recognition.

Testing a machine learning model for face recognition using OpenFace pytorch model converted to keras model by https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace

##steps to test the model 

1)clone this repository to your google drive. 
2)open Face_recognition google colab ipynb and run the code to mount gdrive 
3)put test images in the "test_image" folder
4)put positive example of test image with name in "image" folder 
5)run every block and observe the predicted result.
